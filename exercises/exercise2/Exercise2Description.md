# Exercise 2:

## Due Date: Sunday January 16 2022, 11:59 PM 

## Objectives: To get familiar with javascript functional prototypes, template strings, arrays and higher order javascript array functions and node modules.

## Specifications/Requirements

1. Description:
   To complete this exercise you will be working in `index.js` and `presidents.js`. In `presidents.js` we have given you an array containing information about the 45 presidents of America. You need to export this array so other node modules can use it. In `index.js` we have given you a main function that you need to complete. You will be using the javascript functional prototype provided in the comments in order to obtain the required data and display it in the console using template strings to format output. You will be using the array defined in `presidents.js` as the array you will be acting upon inside of `main`.  

2. Formating and output:
   You will be logging all your results to the console, and the specification as to how the ouput should look are included in the comments above each exercise. If there are no specifications for an exercises output you may assume that there is no special formating associated with that exercise.

3. Additional Notes:
   You should not alter the presidents data we provide you with. This should go without saying, but you should not hardcode your results, we will check your submissions to make sure this does not happen. You should use the functional array prototypes that we have gone over in class and that are mentioned in this exercise (map, sort, filter, reduce), using for loops, for..of loops, while loops, etc will result in a substantial amount of point deduction.
